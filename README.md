## Dotfiles
A set of dotfiles I created/gathered. Since I mostly use Mac, these are geared toward Mac environment, but most should still work in any unix environment.

### Install
Installation is handled by DotBot
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:scottmo/dotfiles.git
$ cd ~/dotfiles
$ ./install
```
